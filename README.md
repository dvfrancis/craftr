# THIS IS A DRAFT DOCUMENT, AND NOT YET FINALISED #

# Craftr

## Overview

Craftr is an annual online (fictional) event dedicated to digital crafting, bringing together creative minds from around the world to explore the latest innovations in craft technology. Held over three days every April, this year's event will take place from 21 to 23 April 2025.

Digital crafting is the dynamic fusion of technology and creativity, enabling individuals to design and create unique projects with precision and innovation. This evolving craft field spans a variety of disciplines, including:

- **Paper and Card Crafts**: ranging from scrapbooking to personalized greeting cards.

- **Vinyl and Decal Crafts**: stickers, signage, decals, and vinyl applications.

- **Graphic Design Applications**: custom artwork for t-shirts, drinkware, and other merchandise.

- **Fabric Crafts**: intricate embroidery, textile design, and fabric embellishments.

- **3D Modelling**: digital sculpting that brings ideas to life.

To achieve professional results, many digital crafters utilize cutting machines such as [Cricut](https://cricut.com/en-gb/) or [Silhouette](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/), or even laser cutters like [Glowforge](https://glowforge.com/)), to create intricate and precise designs that can be applied to a variety of materials.

This website serves as the central hub for Craftr, providing information about the event, allowing participants to create accounts, browse, and register for available classes. Whether a beginner looking to experiment with digital crafting or an expert seeking new techniques, Craftr is the perfect platform for anyone to connect, learn, and create.
